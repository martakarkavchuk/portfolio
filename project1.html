                <h3>Week 5: Updated My Portfolio</h3>
                <p>During this semester, I am focused on learning more about networking, IP addressing, data encryption, troubleshooting, and protection techniques. While studying cybersecurity with the <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking-basics?courseLang=en-US&utm_campaign=writ&utm_content=networking-basics-get-started-button&utm_source=cisco.com&utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">22-hour Cisco Networking Basics course</a>, I am applying my newfound knowledge by creating mini-projects.</p>
                
                <p>This week, I've made several improvements to my portfolio, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a navigation bar for easier site navigation.</li>
                    <li>Improved CSS to make the design more user-friendly and professional.</li>
                    <li>Created a dedicated page for my projects, where I can track and showcase my progress.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These updates reflect my learning and growing skills in web design and networking concepts.</p>

                <p>Additionally, I am continuing my study in cybersecurity and working on a project based on this knowledge. After completing the Cisco course, I plan to explore AI tools like <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> to help me design and simulate network configurations, as well as security measures.</p>

            <h3>Mini-Projects and Timeline</h3>
            <p>As part of my learning process, I plan to complete mini-projects every 3 weeks to apply my knowledge and strengthen my understanding. Below are the mini-projects I plan to work on:</p>
            
            <div class="mini-projects">
                <h4>Mini-Project 1: Setting Up a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Network</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 1-3</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The first project will focus on setting up a simple, secure, and functional SOHO network. I'll create a basic network structure that supports wireless and wired devices, ensuring a secure connection using basic networking protocols (TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS). I’ll also apply knowledge of subnets and IP addressing to optimize network performance and security.</p>
                
                <h4>Mini-Project 2: Creating and Configuring VLANs</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 4-6</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The second mini-project will involve the configuration of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs). I’ll learn how to logically segment a network to improve performance and security. Each VLAN will be designed to group devices with similar needs and work on inter-VLAN routing to ensure proper communication between the segments.</p>

                <h4>Mini-Project 3: Setting Up a Firewall and Basic Security Measures</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 7-9</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For the third project, I will set up a firewall and implement basic security policies. This project will help me understand how firewalls filter traffic, manage network security, and protect against unauthorized access. I will also explore intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and apply basic encryption techniques.</p>

                <h4>Mini-Project 4: Network Troubleshooting and Performance Monitoring</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 10-12</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The fourth project will focus on troubleshooting network issues and monitoring network performance. I'll use tools like ping, traceroute, and netstat to identify network problems and fix them. Additionally, I will configure network monitoring tools to ensure the network is running optimally.</p>

                <h4>Mini-Project 5: VPN Setup for Remote Connectivity</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 13-15</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The fifth mini-project will involve setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access. I’ll learn about different types of VPNs (site-to-site and client-to-site) and their use cases, as well as how to implement VPNs for remote workers and secure communication.</p>

                <h4>Mini-Project 6: Advanced Network Security Techniques</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 16-18</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this final project, I will explore advanced network security techniques, including configuring advanced firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and security protocols. I will also explore how to secure wireless networks and apply encryption methods like IPsec and SSL/TLS.</p>
            </div>

            <p>By completing these mini-projects, I’ll not only reinforce my knowledge of network concepts but also gain hands-on experience with real-world networking and cybersecurity techniques.</p>
