                    <h3>Week 1: Setting Up and Planning</h3>
                    <h4>I created html page for my projects and decided what I want to do as my final project. 
                        <br>My goal during these 10 weeks is to learn more about networking, IP adressing, data encryption, troubleshooting and protection techniques. 
                        <br>I plan to use the <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking-basics?courseLang=en-US&utm_campaign=writ&utm_content=networking-basics-get-started-button&utm_source=cisco.com&utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">Cisco Networking Basics Course</a> to study cybersecurity and their Packet Tracer to practice, by creating mini-projects, and for my final project.
                        <br>My final project will be a network, which i will improve as I learn new things about cybersecurity to make it fast, efficient and secure.
                        <br>Another tools I plan to utilize are <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> to help me design and simulate network configurations, as well as security measures, YouTube, w3school website and any other free online resources.
                        <br>During this week I created this html page dedicated for this project, which will track and showcase my progress.
                    </h4>
                    <p>During this semester, I am focused on learning more about networking, IP addressing, data encryption, troubleshooting, and protection techniques. While studying cybersecurity with the <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking-basics?courseLang=en-US&utm_campaign=writ&utm_content=networking-basics-get-started-button&utm_source=cisco.com&utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">22-hour Cisco Networking Basics course</a>, I am applying my newfound knowledge by creating mini-projects.</p>
                
                    <p>This week, I've made several improvements to my portfolio, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added a navigation bar for easier site navigation.</li>
                        <li>Improved CSS to make the design more user-friendly and professional.</li>
                        <li>Created a dedicated page for my projects, where I can track and showcase my progress.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These updates reflect my learning and growing skills in web design and networking concepts.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I am continuing my study in cybersecurity and working on a project based on this knowledge. After completing the Cisco course, I plan to explore AI tools like </p>

                <h3>Week 9: Planning the home network project</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I plan on creating a network, for practice I will start by trying to create a small house network</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This project required me to download the <a href="https://www.netacad.com/resources/lab-downloads">Cisco Packeet Tracer</a></li>
                        <li>Then I created new project and saved it</li>
                        <li>I put there 5 clients and one server and one router and connected them</li>
                        <li>To secure the network I added a firewall</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3>Week 10: Along with doing getting through Cisco Networking Basics course, I finished the small network in Cisco Packet Tracer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I finished Unit 3 of Cisco: Networking Basics course, which taught me about wireless and mobile networks.</li>
                    <li>Also I started Unit 4, which is about the building of home network, what it consists of and what are the functions of every part.</li>
                    <li>I played with Cisco Packet Tracer and created a small network with a few clients, one switch, one router and one server.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Week 11: My MVP</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>During these 11 weeks I learned the some of the basics of cybersecurity and networking and plan to continue acquiring knowledge in that field.</li>
                    <li>I finished 4 Units of Cisco Basic Networking course.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unit 1: Communication in Connected World <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It taught me about different network types, data transmission, bandwidth and throughput.</li>
                        <li>Unit 2: Network Components, Types and Connections <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit gave me a better understanding of what are the basic componengts of simple networks and what their job is. I learned about different types of end devices: variety of clients and servers that people use in their daily lives. Examples of comonly used clients are computers, tablets, laptops and smartphones, they all use installed software to request and display the information from different servers, such as email and web pages. Nowadays computers can act as both clients and servers of the network. This type of network is calle Peer-to-Peer Network. Another topic that I learned in this unit was the ISP (Internet Services Provider) services and connectivity options used to connect disparate types of devices.</li>
                        <li>Unit 3: Wireless and Mobile Networks <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this unit I learned about </li>
                        <li>Unit 4: Build a Hokme Network <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit taught me how to create</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Moving forward I plan to fo finish Cisco Netwrorking Basics Course and make my Network more complicated, meaning that I would love to add some firrewalls and etc.</li>

            <h3>Mini-Projects and Timeline</h3>
            <p>As part of my learning process, I completed mini-projects to apply my knowledge and strengthen my understanding. Below are the mini-projects I created:</p>
            
            <div class="mini-projects">
                <h4>Mini-Project 1: Setting Up a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Network</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 12-13</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The first project focused on setting up a simple, secure, and functional SOHO network. I created a basic network structure that supports wireless and wired devices, ensuring a secure connection using basic networking protocols (TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS). I also applied knowledge of subnets and IP addressing to optimize network performance and security.</p>
                
                <h4>Mini-Project 2: Creating and Configuring VLANs</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 13-14</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The second mini-project will involve the configuration of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs). I’ll learn how to logically segment a network to improve performance and security. Each VLAN will be designed to group devices with similar needs and work on inter-VLAN routing to ensure proper communication between the segments.</p>

                
            <p>By completing these mini-projects, I’ll not only reinforce my knowledge of network concepts but also gain hands-on experience with real-world networking and cybersecurity techniques.</p>
