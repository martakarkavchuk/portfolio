                    <h3>Week 1: Setting Up and Planning</h3>
                    <h4>I created html page for my projects and decided what I want to do as my final project. 
                        <br>My goal during these 10 weeks is to learn more about networking, IP adressing, data encryption, troubleshooting and protection techniques. 
                        <br>I plan to use the <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking-basics?courseLang=en-US&utm_campaign=writ&utm_content=networking-basics-get-started-button&utm_source=cisco.com&utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">Cisco Networking Basics Course</a> to study cybersecurity and their Packet Tracer to practice, by creating mini-projects, and for my final project.
                        <br>My final project will be a network, which i will improve as I learn new things about cybersecurity to make it fast, efficient and secure.
                        <br>Another tools I plan to utilize are <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> to help me design and simulate network configurations, as well as security measures, YouTube, w3school website and any other free online resources.
                        <br>During this week I created this html page dedicated for this project, which will track and showcase my progress.
                    </h4>
                    <p>During this semester, I am focused on learning more about networking, IP addressing, data encryption, troubleshooting, and protection techniques. While studying cybersecurity with the <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking-basics?courseLang=en-US&utm_campaign=writ&utm_content=networking-basics-get-started-button&utm_source=cisco.com&utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">22-hour Cisco Networking Basics course</a>, I am applying my newfound knowledge by creating mini-projects.</p>
                
                    <p>This week, I've made several improvements to my portfolio, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added a navigation bar for easier site navigation.</li>
                        <li>Improved CSS to make the design more user-friendly and professional.</li>
                        <li>Created a dedicated page for my projects, where I can track and showcase my progress.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These updates reflect my learning and growing skills in web design and networking concepts.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I am continuing my study in cybersecurity and working on a project based on this knowledge. After completing the Cisco course, I plan to explore AI tools like </p>

            <h3>Mini-Projects and Timeline</h3>
            <p>As part of my learning process, I completed mini-projects to apply my knowledge and strengthen my understanding. Below are the mini-projects I created:</p>
            
            <div class="mini-projects">
                <h4>Mini-Project 1: Setting Up a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Network</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 12-13</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The first project focused on setting up a simple, secure, and functional SOHO network. I created a basic network structure that supports wireless and wired devices, ensuring a secure connection using basic networking protocols (TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS). I also applied knowledge of subnets and IP addressing to optimize network performance and security.</p>
                
                <h4>Mini-Project 2: Creating and Configuring VLANs</h4>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Weeks 13-14</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The second mini-project will involve the configuration of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs). I’ll learn how to logically segment a network to improve performance and security. Each VLAN will be designed to group devices with similar needs and work on inter-VLAN routing to ensure proper communication between the segments.</p>

                
            <p>By completing these mini-projects, I’ll not only reinforce my knowledge of network concepts but also gain hands-on experience with real-world networking and cybersecurity techniques.</p>
