                <h3>Week 5: Updated My Portfolio</h3>
                <p>During this semester, I am focused on learning more about networking, IP addressing, data encryption, troubleshooting, and protection techniques. While studying cybersecurity with the <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking-basics?courseLang=en-US&utm_campaign=writ&utm_content=networking-basics-get-started-button&utm_source=cisco.com&utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">22-hour Cisco Networking Basics course</a>, I am applying my newfound knowledge by creating mini-projects.</p>
                
                <p>This week, I've made several improvements to my portfolio, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a navigation bar for easier site navigation.</li>
                    <li>Improved CSS to make the design more user-friendly and professional.</li>
                    <li>Created a dedicated page for my projects, where I can track and showcase my progress.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These updates reflect my learning and growing skills in web design and networking concepts.</p>

                <p>Additionally, I am continuing my study in cybersecurity and working on a project based on this knowledge. After completing the Cisco course, I plan to explore AI tools like <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> to help me design and simulate network configurations, as well as security measures.</p>
