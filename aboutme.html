        <h1>Marta Karkavchuk</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
        <p>I am a high school senior interested in pursuing a career in technology. Over the past three years, I have taken multiple Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics classes that have helped me strengthen my problem-solving and analytical skills. Some of the courses I have completed include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer Science Honors</li>
            <li>AP Computer Science A</li>
            <li>Advanced Computer Science Topics</li>
            <li>AP Calculus AB</li>
            <li>AP Physics 1 & 2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beyond academics, I have actively participated in several school clubs and events. These include the Robotics Club, Computer Science Club, Girls Who Code, French Club, and Ping Pong Club. These experiences have allowed me to collaborate, develop leadership skills, and grow as both a student and a team member.</p>
